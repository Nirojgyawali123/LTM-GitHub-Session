The most interesting things in the techmonth is the whole event. How can someon think that a bunch of student can handle and manage the 1 month workshop. It was totally mesmering me. The way mentor guide us with their knowledge and experiencing was awesome. I was facinate by their teaching way. They also have games that help in refreshment. So i want to thanks all the techmonth organizing team as well as the mentors for providing us with valuable knowledge.
